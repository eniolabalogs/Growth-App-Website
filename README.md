# SaaS Company Landing Page

This is a sample website I worked on for a sample saas company. It was a guided project that expanded my knowlege on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project is from the [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/?ref=traversy) challenge website and does not use any frameworks or libraries. It is built with pure HTML and CSS and a bit of JavaScript for the hamburger menu and the FAQ accordion.
